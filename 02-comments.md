## Comments in Swift Code
Comments are used to annotate the code with helpful descriptions so that it becomes easier to read and understand.

**Example**:
```swift
// This is a single line comment

/* 
   This is a 
   multiline comment.
*/

/// This is a documentation comment. It's often used to describe interfaces.
func sum(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}
```

Remember, writing clean, well-commented code can help others understand your intent and make collaborative efforts smoother.
